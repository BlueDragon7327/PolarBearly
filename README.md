## 🌟 About PolarBearly

**PolarBearly** is a "self hosted" version of [Bearly.ai](https://bearly.ai) that allows you to use **TOR proxies + temporary emails** to infinitely use Bearly without paying.  

---

## 🧠 How does it work?

I was trying to find insecure AI platforms and reverse their API for a project, and stumbled on Bearly.  

Instead of enforcing account limits, it uses **IP-level limits**, allowing you to:

- Use **temporary emails**  
- Route requests through **local TOR proxies**  


<details>
<summary>💡 Workflow</summary>

1. Generate temp email via mail.tm or a similar API 
2. Connect to local TOR proxy  
3. Make chat completion requests to Bearly API  
4. Rotate IP & account to bypass limits
