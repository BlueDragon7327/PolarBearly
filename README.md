# 🧠 How does it work?

### Well, I was trying to find insecure AI platforms and reverse their API for one of my projects, and I came accross Bearly, which, instead of setting account level usage limits, it sets IP level limits, allowing you to use a temp mail API such as mail.tm, along with local TOR proxies.
